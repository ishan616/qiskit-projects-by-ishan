Qiskit Projects by Ishan

This repository contains some simple qiskit projects that illustrate the basics of quantum computing. Since this is a field of current active research, not all of the projects have immediate real world applications. But they are useful in demonstrating the underlying quantum phenomena and the non-binary math required to understand Quantum Computing devices.

Some basic knowledge of python programming is assumed. (If you are on GitHub, this assumption is a priory).
Familarity with IBM's qiskit package is also assumed.

The code snippets/scripts in this repo are written for independant execution.
